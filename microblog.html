<p>Time to switch things up (kinda)</p>
<p>Random curiosity: Catalonia is just ditching Windows and getting Ubuntu installed on their computers and use FireFox instead of Chrome, IE (not sure if they still use it tho) or Edge. I knew I had to switch to Linux.</p>

<p>Here's two thing today:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First: I don't even know why the hell am I following people back. Is it my dopamine or whateverthehellisit?</li>
  <li>Second: Why does ChromeOS map the "<" and the ">" key as the same in spanish and english? That should be \ or ~ tho.</li>

<p>Uhh so Youtube is dumb as if you put a video on an iframe doesn't give you ads. Time to watch everything on an iframe and suffer as fullscreen is not allowed.</p>
